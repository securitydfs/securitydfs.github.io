This generally involves discovering an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that allows more light to get in the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is allowed to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
