SimpliSafe likewise beats ADT with month-to-month monitoring that comes in at about half the cost. That said, ADT is the best known brand name in the market for a reason, and their remarkable equipment and monitoring service tend to justify the greater rate for many house owners. If you own a home (specifically a larger home) and want the best possible system to secure your home against all contingencies, then choose ADT.</p>
