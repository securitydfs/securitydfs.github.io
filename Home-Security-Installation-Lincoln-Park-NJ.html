Rules are required to develop a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and the length of time are they retained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be validated and implemented; and what penalties would apply to violators.</p>
