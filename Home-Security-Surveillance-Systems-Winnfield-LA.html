<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
