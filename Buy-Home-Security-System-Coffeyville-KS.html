<p>Indoor cameras are great for watching on your kids and pets, however if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with options for more by means of subscription. Although it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a really weatherproof cord and plug.

<p>Whatever in the Standard Monitoring package, access to Total Link Remote Services, Service to all parts and pieces of your system, a Cellular Protection Strategy that offers you with updates to the cellular communication device, Annual Fire Screening, and more.
