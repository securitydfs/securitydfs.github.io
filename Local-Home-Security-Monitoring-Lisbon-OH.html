<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public camera need to be stabilized versus the dangers and expenses. This technology (a) has the possible modification the core experience of going out in public in America due to the fact that of its chilling effect on citizens, (b) brings very real dangers of abuse and "objective creep," and (c) would not significantly secure us versus terrorism. Considered that, its advantages - avoiding at many a few street criminal activities, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
