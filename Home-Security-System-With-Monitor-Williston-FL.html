<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
