<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR.
