Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped.

This choice is usually cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video clips in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
