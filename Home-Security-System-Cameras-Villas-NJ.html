<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
