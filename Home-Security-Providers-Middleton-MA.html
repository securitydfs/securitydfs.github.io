<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
