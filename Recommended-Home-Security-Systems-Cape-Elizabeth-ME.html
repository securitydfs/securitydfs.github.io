<p>If you wish to playback your home's outdoor activity, you'll need a camera with onboard video storage or cloud recording abilities.

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
