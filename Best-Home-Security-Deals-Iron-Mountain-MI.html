Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
