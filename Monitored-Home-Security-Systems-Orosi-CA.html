<p>Some wireless systems are susceptible to electro-magnetic or structural disturbance. Radio frequencies walk around solid things; they can not go through them. So placing sensors in the right locations is crucial if you want them to work properly. Your alarm company ought to inform you precisely where each part must be set up so there is no confusion. It uses an exclusive connection approach that doesn't deal with Z-Wave or Zigbee like a lot of other home automation gadgets. Plus, there's no professional monitoring option and no siren.</p>

The Maximus light itself is also a wise light, and the entire fixture gives you options like customizable light settings and pre-recorded messages that will play when the camera detects motion.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Calling in a specialist costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert deal with the job and do not mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
