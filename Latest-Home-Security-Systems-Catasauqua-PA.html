<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smart device informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
