<p>The only genuine issue we have is with the cost. The package isn't at all cheap in the first location, however if you wish to store 4K recordings in the cloud you'll require a higher-tier additional subscription. Nonetheless, it's hard to argue that the Arlo Ultra doesn't earn its price - it's simply that it's quite a niche item because of that cost, when the Arlo Pro 3 has the same smarts for less.

A great deal of wise cameras can be configured to do things like this, however few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
