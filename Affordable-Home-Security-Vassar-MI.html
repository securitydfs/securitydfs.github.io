Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically difficult agreements, and typically depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually examined independently and do not advise for the majority of people.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
