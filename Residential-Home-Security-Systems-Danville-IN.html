<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a family pet cam ). It has actually given that been enhanced and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

The density of access points can even be an issue - there are a limited variety of channels readily available, and they partially overlap.
