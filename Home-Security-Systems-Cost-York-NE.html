<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
<p>The system is lacking in just two areas-- security add-ons and smart home add-ons-- where it ranks Good and Fair, respectively, because you can't expand the system with as many additional security and clever home gadgets as completing systems.

We believe that's pricey.</p>
