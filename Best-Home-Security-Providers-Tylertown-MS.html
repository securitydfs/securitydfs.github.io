<p>Houston home alarm companies that use totally free" alarm are simply concealing the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is paid for within the very first year, however do they lower your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years.
